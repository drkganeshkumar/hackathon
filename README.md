## Video Analytics

*This hackathon may provide us with the necessary experience, and addressing issues for Bank of Baroda and other banks may allow us to investigate difficulties in the sector*. 

*We were interested in resolving thisproblem statement as a result of employing solutions like Microsoft Azure.*

*Because the video analytics offered by our solution will be helpful in
understanding how customers are responding to and feeling about the
activities that they are conducting in the bank, the customer service
segment will be the first to adopt it.*

*which will assist the administrators in better training their personnel.*

*Some of the alternatives to the issue that we are resolving include Promobot, Emotibot, and
CrowdEmotion.*

*For this prototype, we'll probably employ Microsoft Azure's machine
learning, cognitive services, applied AI services, and cognitive search.*

*The video feeds being captured by the dome cameras should be instantly uploaded to the cloud because we are using Microsoft Azure.*

*The artificial intelligence created utilising the aforementioned Azure tools and services is then fed these captured films.*

*The footage will subsequently be analysed by artificial intelligence, which will also
provide video analytics. These analytics will be able to identify consumer sentiments,
count the number of persons in the film, and determine how long an activity took
place on the bank's premises.* 

*We need graphs for all the analytics, along with summaries that will make it easier to comprehend them. Since we intend to use
Microsoft Azure, the scalability is determined by the quantity of virtual machines that
are active at any given time.*

*Scalability is predicated on Azure's capacity for growth.*

*From both the stream side and the cloud side, our solution is entirely
automatic. After development, our steps will make it simple to implement
the solution for the bank.*

*As part of our approach, we will first gather recording from the bank, utilise those to train the artificial intelligence we
will develop using machine learning, and then optimise the artificialintelligence to deliver better video analytics.*
